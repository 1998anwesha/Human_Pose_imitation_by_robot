### Real-time Human Pose imitation by Baxter
We have used the same kineval-stencil for our project as present [here](https://gitlab.eecs.umich.edu/lzhh/autolab). Please include the home.html, the pose.py and the kineval_servo_control.js file with the stencil to implement this project. 
You can check the [poster](https://github.com/1998anwesha/Human_Pose_imitation_by_robot/blob/main/CopyCat%20-%20mimicking%20human%20pose%20by%20baxter.pdf) of our presenetation which has a summary of models used, angle calculation procedures, and how we have used Flask and websocket to establish connetion between our python script (pose.py) and kineval environment.
